Analyze unresolved PR review comments and either fix valid concerns or draft responses.

IMPORTANT: The parent session may include context about changes made. Use this to better
understand which comments are already addressed.

## Workflow

1. **Fetch unresolved comments**:
   - If PR number provided, use it directly
   - Otherwise auto-detect: `gh pr view --json number,headRefName`
   - Get inline comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments`
   - Get review-level comments: `gh pr view <number> --json reviews,comments`
   - Filter to unresolved/pending threads

2. **For each comment, decide**:
   - **Valid concern needing code change**: fix it, AND search codebase for same problem
     in other locations. Fix ALL occurrences, not just the one mentioned
   - **Not a valid concern**: draft a response (don't post yet)
   - **Automated bot comment**: single concise sentence, no pleasantries, just state the fact

3. **Response style**:
   - lowercase start, no complex sentences
   - never use em-dashes (`—`, `–`, `--`) between sentences, expressions, examples, or terms. Use commas, periods, or "or" instead
   - simple terms, concise, no end punctuation if possible
   - max 1 sentence or shorter
   - polite when responding to real people
   - bot comments: no pleasantries ("good catch", "nice find", "thanks"), just state the fact directly

4. **Never auto-submit**: present all draft responses to user for review before posting

5. **Post responses** only after explicit human approval:
   - Reply comments (responses to existing threads) are posted directly, not as pending
   - Add a random 3-5 second delay between each reply: `sleep $((RANDOM % 3 + 3))`
